# Description / Instructions

This is a simple app for monitoring feed times when breastfeeding. Simply tap on the button that corresponds to the side you are feeding from, and tap the same button when the feed is finished. The app will log the output in localStorage so you can easily and simply keep track of feeds as they happen.

App is available at https://evie-s-feeds.web.app

As it is a progressive web app, you can add it to the homescreen of your device and it will function like a normal app.
